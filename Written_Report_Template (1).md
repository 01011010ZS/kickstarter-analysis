# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project was to leverage data to better understand how how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was conducted using data from the Kickstarter lesson file. The updated file can be found in my [GitHub folder] (https://github.com/01011010ZS/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) There were no significant challenges experienced while conducting the assignment.  Possible challenges when conducting the analysis may include errors when copying formulas between cells which can result in in inaccurate results.  However, I did experience challenges with creating the md file report as this is the first time using this software.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Using the md format is really difficult for me considering I have never used it before!

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The results of the analyiss indicate that the May timeframe yields the best results for outcomes.
Additionally, as the duration of the campaign continues success rates decline.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Otcomes based on goals are significantly higher in campaigns with goals less than $5000.  Failure rates are higher at higher goals with some outliers at the highest goals amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of the dataset include age and financial demographics of the targeted pledge participant.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Possible additional tables and graphs include measures of central tendency and distributions with box plots.
